# INFgamma_biotech
Plasmid technology versus phage-depend technology.
This Python script compares IFN-Î³ production yields between plasmid-based and bacteriophage-based technologies using statistical analysis and visualization.

Simulated Data : Generates synthetic data for demonstration (replace with real data).
Statistical Test : Performs a t-test to compare means (p-value < 0.05 indicates significance).
Visualization : Creates a boxplot to show yield distributions.
Requirements : Python 3.x + pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn.
Usage : Run python analyze_ifn_gamma.py to see results.
Example Output :
T-statistic: -2.15, p-value: 0.0352
"Statistically significant difference in yields."
Interpretation : p < 0.05 suggests meaningful yield differences.
Customization : Replace simulated data with experimental results.
Assumptions : Assumes normal distribution; use non-parametric tests for skewed data.
Contact : Modify the script for advanced analyses (e.g., ANOVA).
